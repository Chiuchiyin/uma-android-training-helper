# Data Template

Visit GameTora's Training Event Helper at (https://gametora.com/umamusume/training-event-helper) and select the Character or Support Card that you want to work on. Then select an event and a popup will appear with the event results for each option:

<img src="./example1.png" alt="Example 1 from GameTora" />

Then head on over to the respective Data class and under their category, copy and paste from the popup's text and format it like so:

<img src="./example1_formatted.png" alt="Formatted String Event of Example 1 from GameTora" />

- Line Breaks are denoted by "\n".
- The 1st Option as the first element of the array, the 2nd Option as the second element, etc.

When you encounter an event like this:

<img src="./example2.png" alt="Example 2 from GameTora" />

You format the event text like so:

<img src="./example2_formatted.png" alt="Formatted String Event of Example 2 from GameTora" />

- The lines to break up each potential reward within one option is denoted by "\n----------\n".
